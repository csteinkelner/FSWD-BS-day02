				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>
				A little cycle truck putters down a rural road in post-war Japan, carrying four-year-old Mei, her older sister Satsuki, and their father Professor Kusakabe to a new home in the country to be closer to the rural hospital where the girls' mother is recovering from an unspecified (but potentially deadly) disease. Along with the usual tribulations of moving—a spooky old house, new neighbors, fitting in at a new school—Mei encounters an odd little creature in the backyard. While pursuing it, she comes upon the den of a much larger forest spirit that she eventually calls "Totoro". At first, Mei is the only one who sees Totoro, but Satsuki soon meets him as well, and the girls have several fantastic encounters with Totoro, interwoven between subplots involving their family and (human) neighbors.<br/> <br>
				But the girls' seemingly idyllic rural existence is soon shattered when a health crisis forces their mother to cancel a much-anticipated visit home. Heartbroken, the two girls take out their fear and anger on each other, and Mei eventually sets out for the hospital alone, determined to deliver an ear of corn she believes will make her mother well. The remainder of the film revolves around Satsuki's increasingly desperate search for Mei; when all other options are exhausted, Satsuki appeals directly to Totoro for help—and he is more than delighted to be of assistance.<br/> <br>
				Totoro is one of Miyazaki's best known films. Totoro himself became the mascot for Studio Ghibli. Miyazaki does not gloss over some of the more frightening aspects of childhood, though: the girls are terrified of their mother dying, a common goat seems monstrous from little Mei's perspective, and the whole village's fright and anxiety when Mei goes missing is almost palpable. Even Totoro—with his huge grin, inscrutable expression, and manic eyes—can be a little scary; Satsuki refers to meeting him as both the funniest and the scariest day of her life.
